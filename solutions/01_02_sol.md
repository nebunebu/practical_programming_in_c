# Problem 1.2

Consider the statement  

```c
double ans = 18.0/squared(2+1);
```

For each of the four versions of the function `macro squared()`
below, write the corresponding value  of ans.  

1.

```c
#define squared(x) x*x
``````

2. #define squared(x) (x*x)  
3. #define squared(x) (x)*(x)  
4. #define squared(x) ((x)*(x))
